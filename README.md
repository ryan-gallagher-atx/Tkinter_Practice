# Tkinter_Practice
Learning Tkinter via following along a tutorial. 

I'm looking for a good Tkinter tutorial to follow along with to build something from scratch with the goal of learning Tkinter so that I can use is for my Hasami Shogi game.
Once I find a good tutorial, I will reference it here in the readme. Likewise, I will also describe the project more in depth.

Ended up following along with a tictactoe tkinter tutorial that I referenced inside of my program.

I changed a few things to simplify and shorten the code.

A few additons to this that come to mind:
-Adding an AI to play against
-Simplifying the win condition code more
-Giving a prompt to the player to choose if they want to be X's or O's
